    <p class="scroll">I was 8, clumsy and sheepish. She was almost 10, with a personality of bright sunshine mixed with copious quantities of thunderstorm. Mr. Bishter's field was her favorite playground where I helped her steal the sweet red strawberries and carried them around in my Pokemon themed denim pouch. One of the first times we did this, I had asked her why she wasn't scared of Mr. Bishter; he had a reputation for anger and loved his damn strawberries. She said it was because she had me. </p>
