See how Peace, Harmony, Compassion, Creativity, and Abundance for example, are all qualities that come from your core essence and how they embody the heart of unconditional love. When you are conscious of these powerful characteristics like Courage, Choice, Gratitude and Potential, you transform your personal understanding into greater awareness. This book brings the many facets of your life into focus by revealing how these potent aspects weave through every part of your life.</p>
